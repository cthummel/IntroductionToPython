   "source": "## Installation.\n\nWe need to install Python and Visual Studio Code for this demo. Getting the jupyter notebook and git are recommended but not needed. \n\n### Required:\n\n#### 1) Clone this repository: \nClick on the big green button and select \"Download as Zip\". This will download all the files you need for this class.\n\n\n#### 2) Python\nTo install Python, you will need to visit this website and download the version that matches your operating system. You can find the installer at the bottom of the page.\n<a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/</a>\n\n\nOnce downloaded, double click on \"Install Certificates\". This will open a termnial window but dont worry.\n\n\n#### 3) Visual Studio Code\nWe will be writing our command line program in Visual Studio Code. This is a free IDE that allows programming in a variety of languages.\n<a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com\n\nOnce you have installed Visual Studio, when you open it up you will want to click on the box like icon on the left hand side of the window. This will open up the extensions that Visual Studio has installed. We want to install the Python linter. This will be labeled \"Python\" and is published by Microsoft. Just click the green install button and you will be good to go. A linter is a feature that is basically like a spell checker for programming. It will tell you if you have made some sort of mistake that will cause the program to fail to run. \n\nIf you have any issues with this step we will go over it at the start of class so dont worry too much.\n\n\n### Optional:\n\nThe following two programs are useful in a general sense but we wont be working with them directly for this class. If you are interested, feel free to pick these up.\n\n#### 1) Jupyter Notebook\nJupyter Notebook is a program that lets you format your code in a way that makes it more accessable for non-programmers to understand. You can embed runable python code with accompanying text in order to make a presentable product.\n\nTo install you need to open terminal and run:\n\n```pip3 install jupyter```\n\nTo start the notebook run:\n\n```jupyter notebook```\n\n#### 2) Git\nGit is basically google docs for programmers. If you are planning on working collaberatively on just about any programming project, you will be coordinating work through git. It isnt too difficult to learn the basics and is very useful for version control.\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n\nYou can clone from my repository for this project at:\n\nhttps://github.com/cthummel/IntroductionToPython\n\nThis can be done on the command line with:\n\n```git clone https://github.com/cthummel/IntroductionToPython```\n\nor by selecting the big green button and downloading the zip."
