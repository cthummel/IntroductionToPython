# IntroductionToPython

## Installation.

We need to install Python and Visual Studio Code for this demo. Getting the jupyter notebook and git are recommended but not needed.

### Required) Python
To install Python, you will need to visit this website and download the version that matches your operating system.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/

### Required) Visual Studio Code
We will be writing our command line program in visual studio code. This is a free IDE that allows programming in a variety of languages. 
https://code.visualstudio.com

Once you have installed Visual Studio, when you open it up you will want to click on the box like icon on the left hand side of the window. This will open up the extensions that Visual Studio has installed. We want to install the Python linter. This will be labeled "Python" and is published by Microsoft. Just click the green install button and you will be good to go. A linter is a feature that is basically like a spell checker for programming. It will tell you if you have made some sort of mistake that will cause the program to fail to run. 

### Optional) Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a program that lets you format your code in a way that makes it more accessable for non-programmers to understand. You can embed runable code with text in order to make a presentable product.

To install you need to open terminal and run:

```pip3 install jupyter```

To start the notebook run:

```jupyter notebook```

### Optional) Git
Git is basically google docs for programmers. If you are planning on working collaberatively on just about any programming project, you will be coordinating work through git. It isnt too difficult to learn the basics and is very useful for version control.
